# Space News App

## About this project
The app shows relevant information about astronomy/space-related things using data that we will be fetching from APIs. The point of this project is for my friend, Wei Jie and i to hopefully be able to understand and get use to using git for collaborating as well as expand our knowledge in popular Javascript frameworks.

## Objectives
 - To know how to use NEXT.js

 - To practice on git collaboration
## Tech Stack 
 - NEXT.js
 - Chakra UI
